## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

Yapper is a modern, full-stack messaging web application that mimics the core features of a real-time chat platform. Users can send direct messages, create and manage group chats, and share media filesâ€”making Yapper a flexible, lightweight alternative to traditional messaging apps.

The app supports rich user interaction through features like GIF sharing (via the GIPHY API), file attachments, user profile customization (avatars and bios), and privacy tools like blocking users. Group chat functionality allows admins to manage members, update group details, and maintain control over the chat environment.

Built with a fast React + Vite frontend and a robust Node.js + PostgreSQL backend (powered by Prisma ORM and Supabase), Yapper offers a smooth and responsive user experienceâ€”perfect for chatting, sharing, and staying connected.
